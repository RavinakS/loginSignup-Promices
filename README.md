this project will look like a lengthy code, because 2-3 lines of code I have written in 10-12 lines, but as I have not mentioned yet that the propose of doing this project is to build my logic and most importantly to understand **Promises** with **function chaining** and to understand the need of **async-await** instead of function chaining. 

- **why lengthy ?-**
I have build some functions with my own logic instead of using shortcut way, like password validation, checking if a string contain number/s etc.

- **Why no async-await ?-**
Because theory part I know why **async-await** instead of **function chaining**(.then/catch) but practically I wanted to undertand the needs of async-await. which I understoon from this project.
